# Defines a docker-compose project that runs the full set of services to run
# a GraphQL Engine instance and two MongoDB connectors. Matches the environment
# used for integration tests. This project is intended for interactive testing,
# so it maps host ports, and sets up a persistent volume for MongoDB.
#
# To see the service port numbers look at integration-test-services.nix
#
# To start this project run:
#
#     arion up -d
#

{ pkgs, ... }:
